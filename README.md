## üìÑ Troubleshooting

- **Port conflicts:** Make sure ports 8000 (backend) and 5173 (frontend) are free.
- **Virtual environment issues:** Ensure you have activated your Python venv before running backend commands.
- **Dependency errors:** Double-check you have installed all requirements for both backend and frontend.
- **Large file errors:** The app is configured to avoid uploading large files to GitHub. Downloads are stored locally and ignored by git.
